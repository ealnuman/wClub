# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-08

This Privacy Policy describes how the wClub Frappe app ("wClub") handles personal data when installed on a customer's Frappe site. This is a template â€” have your legal counsel review and tailor it to your jurisdiction and business needs before publishing.

1. Data Controller

The publisher of the wClub app is Taqrieb Information Technology Company. For privacy inquiries contact: support@taqrieb.com

2. Data Collected

- wClub stores club and member data (names, contact details, membership records, belt awards, payments) in the customer's Frappe site database.
- The app does not transmit this data to external servers by default. Any integration with third-party services (payment gateways, analytics) that sends data off-site must be explicitly configured and disclosed.

3. Purpose and Legal Basis

- Data is processed to provide the membership management service (billing, scheduling, reporting) and to fulfill the customer's use of the app.

4. Third-Party Services

- The base app includes no third-party telemetry. If you enable integrations (for example payment gateways) disclose what is shared and how to opt out.

5. Data Retention

- Data retention is controlled by the customer's Frappe site administrator. wClub does not enforce additional retention beyond standard Document lifecycle in Frappe.

6. Security

- Security is the responsibility of the Frappe site owner and hosting provider. Follow Frappe/ERPNext security best practices for access control and backups.

7. Your Rights

- Data subject access, correction, and deletion should be handled by the site's administrator according to local law.

8. Changes to This Policy

- We may update this policy; the `Last updated` date above will change. For questions contact support@taqrieb.com.
